#You are obsessed with vaults, and the most new vault is just arrived.
#The new vault called VaultClue, because it has no password!!.
#The VaultClue is working by the concept of Bagels

#Bagels is a deduction game in which the player tries to guess a random three-digit number (with no repeating digits) generated by the computer.
After each guess, the computer gives the player three types of clues:
	Bagels: None of the three digits guessed is in the secret number.
	Pico: One of the digits is in the secret number, but the guess has the digit in the wrong place.
	Fermi: The guess has a correct digit in the correct place.
The computer can give multiple clues, which are sorted in random order. If the secret number is 456 and the player’s guess is 546,
the clues would be “fermi pico pico” or “pico fermi pico”. 'fermi' from 6 and 'pico pico' from 4 & 5.
